# Linked List Implementation

## Code Challenge 5

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- Create a Linked List class

      Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
      Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

    The class should contain the following methods:

  - insert

        Arguments: value
        Returns: nothing
        Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

  - includes

        Arguments: value
        Returns: Boolean
        Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

  - to string

        Arguments: none
        Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Code Challenge 6

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append

      arguments: new value
      adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before

      arguments: value, new value
      adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after

      arguments: value, new value
      adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Code Challenge 7

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

- kth from end

argument: a number, k, as a parameter.

Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Code Challenge 8

Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big-O for the insert() method is O(1) because it takes the same amount of time to run for any input.
- Big-O for the includes() method is also O(1) I think because of the same reason.
- Big-O for the toString() method is O(n) because it runs n times.
- Big-O for the append() method is O(n) because it runs n times.
- Big-O for the insertBefore method is O(n) because it runs n times.
- Big-O for the insertAfter() method is O(n) because it runs n times.
- Big-O for the kthFromEnd() method is O(n) because it runs n times.
- Big-O for the zipLists() function is O(n) because it runs n times depending on the size of the greatest linked list.

## Solution

- Make an instance of the LinkedList class.
- Use the methods for the class.
- Log output if the method return value.

      const LinkedList = require('./index');
      const linked = new LinkedList();
      linked.insert(5);
      linked.insert(10);
      console.log(linked.toString());
      /// console: { 10 } -> { 5 } -> NULL
